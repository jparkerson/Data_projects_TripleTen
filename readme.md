# TripleTen_projects
Projects I worked on while attending the Business Analytics TripleTen Bootcamp.


| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 1 | NYC Airbnb Data| For this project, the context is that I've been hired to help a client analyze the Manhattan vacation rental market. They want guidance on which property types to invest in, and my task was to analyze Airbnb data for insights, and make recommendations by answering these questions:
Which neighborhoods and property sizes (i.e. number of bedrooms) are most attractive for vacation rentals?
How much money did these listings generate? |
| 2 | Business Analytics Project| In this project, I acted as a Junior Analyst at an e-commerce company. The context is that after searching for months, the company finally found the right candidate (me) to analyze their raw transaction logs, and wanted me to get started immediately. Raw data was provided, I built the conversion funnel, prepared the cohort analysis, calculated first purchase dates, set up monthly data to build and track cohorts, and calculated retention rates, and summarized results in the Executive Summary.|
| 3 |Returns Analysis | The project task was to study what factors lead to customer returns, and how they effect profitability. |
